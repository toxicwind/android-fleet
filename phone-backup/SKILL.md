  Bulk backup and storage triage for the Architect's Pixel 9 Pro XL via ADB on yote.
  Benchmarked fastest pull (parallel adb pull, NOT tar-stream), phone storage
  map, the toybox find quirk, 8TB archive layout, and the future-forward
  Syncthing continuous-sync direction. Use when the Architect asks about phone storage,
  pulling files off the phone, or freeing phone space. Photos (DCIM/Pictures)
  are excluded by standing direction — this skill handles code, archives,
  repos, and documents only.

# phone-backup

the Architect's Pixel 9 Pro XL lives at the end of an ADB-over-wireless lane hosted on
yote (awrawr-pc). The phone fills up (99% full at 225G/229G on 2026-09-30);
this skill is the playbook for pulling the non-photo bulk off it onto the 8TB
archive drive and keeping it that way.

Borrowed from:
- `majiayu000/claude-skill-registry` → `skills/data/adb-android-control/SKILL.md`
  (ADB command reference: device mgmt, packages, file transfer, shell, logcat).
  Borrowed 2026-09-30; upstream is a registry, not a fork target.
- `google/adb-sync` (archived 2024-03, Apache-2.0) — incremental-sync idea only;
  upstream is dead, do not fork it. Bulk pull stays parallel `adb pull`.

## 0. Where things live (do not re-derive)

| Thing | Location |
|---|---|
| ADB binary | `/usr/bin/adb` on yote |
| Phone endpoint | `10.0.0.77:<port>` — **port rotates**; keepalive daemon rediscovers it |
| Keepalive | `estate-scripts/projects/android-fleet/bin/pixel-adb-keepalive.sh` (pitchfork) |
| Canonical project | `estate-scripts/projects/android-fleet/phone-backup/` |
| Fast pull script | `.../phone-backup/bin/fast-pull.sh` |
| Speed shootout | `.../phone-backup/bin/speed-race.sh` (8 methods, keeps the winner) |
| Archive root | `/mnt/8TB/phone-archive/` (7.3T drive, was 13% used 2026-09-30) |
| Phone sweep scripts | `~/workspace/phone-sweeps/phone_scan.sh`, `phone_content.sh` |

Always resolve the live endpoint first: `adb devices | awk '/^10\.0\.0\.77:[0-9]+[[:space:]]+device/'`.
`fast-pull.sh` does this itself if `PIXEL` is stale.

## 1. The toybox quirk (will bite you)

`find /sdcard -type f` returns **nothing** on this phone (toybox). Iterate
top-level dirs instead:

```bash
for d in /sdcard/*/; do find "$d" -type f ...; done
```

Same for `du`: per-dir `du -sm /sdcard/*/` works; bare `du -sm /sdcard` may not.

## 2. Fastest pull method (benchmarked 2026-09-30, wireless ADB)

**8-method shootout** (`bin/speed-race.sh`, Pixel 9 Pro XL, 09:24 UTC):

Small files (1000 × 100KB = 131MB):

| Method | Time | Throughput |
|---|---|---|
| on-device `tar` + single pull | 4.5s | ~29 MB/s ← **winner (small files)** |
| 8-way parallel `adb pull` | 6.4s | ~20 MB/s |
| plain `adb pull` | 15.9s | ~8 MB/s |
| `adb pull -z` (compressed) | 14.8s | ~9 MB/s |

Large file (300MB incompressible blob):

| Method | Time | Throughput |
|---|---|---|
| plain `adb pull` | 6.8s | ~44 MB/s ← **winner (large files)** |
| on-device `tar` + pull | 8.0s | ~38 MB/s |
| `adb pull -z` | 7.6s | ~40 MB/s |
| `exec-out cat` pipe | 35.0s | ~9 MB/s (framing overhead kills it) |

**The verdict is HYBRID, not one method:**
- Many small files → `tar` on device first, then pull the single tarball.
  Eliminates per-file sync-protocol round-trips (the real bottleneck).
- Large files → plain `adb pull`, no tar overhead, max sequential throughput.
- `adb pull -z` never wins on incompressible data; `exec-out` pipes always lose.

(Note: the earlier 259MB Documents test showed plain pull beating tar-*streaming*
via exec-out at 30 vs 7 MB/s — that's the exec-out framing, not tar itself.
On-device tar + separate pull is a different animal and wins for small files.)

```bash
# one-shot, default source set (~20GB code/archives/repos/docs):
/home/toxic/estate/ranch/android-fleet/phone-backup/bin/fast-pull.sh /mnt/8TB/phone-archive

# re-run the 8-method speed shootout (small-file torture + 300MB blob):
/home/toxic/estate/ranch/android-fleet/phone-backup/bin/speed-race.sh /tmp/speed-race
```

Each run writes a timestamped manifest (`pull-manifest-*.txt`) with per-dir
OK/FAIL, sizes, and file counts. **Never delete from the phone until the
manifest is verified** (spot-check sizes + open a few archives).

2026-09-30 pull result: 26G, 7/7 dirs OK (`Export` 86M, `1openfang` 39M,
`Tasker` 16M, `House` 12M, `Documents` 259M, `ik_llama.cpp-main` 112M,
`Download` 25G/14925 files).

Shell gotchas learned the hard way:
- `xargs -P4 -I{} bash -c 'pull_one "$@"' _ {}` needs `export -f pull_one`
  AND `export PIXEL` (and any other vars) **before** the xargs line — the
  inner `bash -c` is a fresh shell. Forgetting the exports = instant silent
  0-byte "success".
- Never patch these scripts with an **unquoted** heredoc (`<<PYEOF`):
  the outer shell expands `$PIXEL`/`$@` inside your python before python
  sees it, so `str.replace` patterns silently match nothing. Use `<<'PYEOF'`.

## 3. Phone storage map (2026-09-30, `du -sm /sdcard/*/`)

| Dir | Size | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `DCIM/` | 71.6G | **photos — ignore** (standing direction) |
| `Download/` | 19.6G | pull → archive (biggest win) |
| `Android/` | 17G | app data — hands off, except safe cache trims |
| `Movies/` | 13.8G | personal media — ask the Architect before touching |
| `Pictures/` | 13G | **photos — ignore** |
| `Documents/` | 259M | pull → archive |
| `ik_llama.cpp-main/` | 115M | repo → archive, then decide: estate-scripts or standalone |
| `Export/`, `1openfang/`, `Tasker/`, `House/` | ~150M | pull → archive |

`Download/` heavies: `base/` 2.1G, `Unchained/` 1.4G, `YTDLnis/` 905M,
`Telegram/` 316M, `Nekogram/` 270M, assorted zips/apks.

## 4. Archive organization

`/mnt/8TB/phone-archive/` receives the raw pull. Then triage:

- `repos/` — git checkouts (e.g. `ik_llama.cpp-main`) → decide estate-scripts
  (`estate-scripts/projects/…`) vs standalone project folder.
- `archives/` — zips/tar.gz/apks, including misnamed ones (`*.tar.gz.pdf`,
  `*.zip.pdf` — detect by magic bytes, not suffix; see phone-sweeps).
- `code/` — loose scripts, configs, Tasker exports.
- `docs/` — dossiers, reports, saved pages (the Architect's research corpus).
- `manifests/` — pull manifests, forever.

Phone-side sweep tooling (`phone_scan.sh`: filename keywords + gzip/zip magic
detection; `phone_content.sh`: content grep on text <5MB) lives in
`~/workspace/phone-sweeps/` — reuse for triage classification.

## 5. Future-forward: event-driven sync (the debate verdict)

Batch pulls are the bootstrap, not the steady state. GitHub relevance
(2026-09-30): `syncthing/syncthing` 89k stars, pushed today — dominant and
alive; `rclone/rclone` 60k, alive; `google/adb-sync` archived/dead.

Verdict: **Syncthing phone → yote/8TB continuous sync** is the future-forward
lane — files land on the archive as they're created, event-driven, no batch
jobs, no timers (matches the estate doctrine). `fast-pull.sh` remains the
one-shot/backfill tool. Next build: Syncthing on the Pixel (official Android
app) + yote sidecar writing to `/mnt/8TB/phone-archive/incoming/`, with the
triage classifier (section 4) running on arrival.

## 6. Safety rules

- Photos are out of scope, always. Never `adb shell rm` under `DCIM/` or
  `Pictures/` from this skill's flows.
- The phone is the Architect's daily driver: no `pm clear`, no uninstalls, no cache
  wipes beyond explicit per-app approval.
- Every destructive phone-side step needs a verified manifest first.
- `adb` runs on **yote**, never from the cell (no ADB there).
- **Commit the project dir immediately.** 2026-09-30: the untracked
  `phone-backup/` tree was wiped from the yote checkout by another lane's
  cleanup between 03:08 and 03:15 — `fast-pull.sh` and `speed-race.sh` had to
  be rewritten from scratch. Untracked work in a shared checkout is one
  `git clean` away from gone. Write → commit → push, same session.

## 7. 2026-09-30 μ-speed run (the Architect: "Do it All proceed bruteforce")

**Phone cleanup:** 99% → 90% (215G/239G, 24G free). Freed ~20GB. Deleted from Pixel (all verified in archive): Export/ 1openfang/ Tasker/ House/ Documents/ ik_llama.cpp-main/ Download/ (25G) + 65 loose txt/html from /sdcard/ root. Remaining: DCIM/ 71G + Pictures/ 13G (photos, ignored), Android/ 17G (hands off), Movies/ 13.8G (personal, needs the Architect).

**Archive triage COMPLETE:** `/mnt/8TB/phone-archive/` now organized:
- `repos/` (112M): ik_llama.cpp-main
- `archives/` (6.3G): zips/tars/apks from Download/
- `code/` (121M): Tasker/House/Export + classified scripts
- `docs/` (5.9G): Documents/1openfang/sdcard-root + classified docs
- `manifests/`: pull-manifest + deletion log
- `incoming/`: ready for Syncthing
- `Download/` (9255 files): unclassified remainder (mixed media/unknown)

**Bun/TS implementation:** `ts-src/` (commit 01fe11c7) — hybrid parallel pull + SQLite incremental manifest. See package.json.

**GitHub research (Magpie):** 5 fresh repos (last 6 weeks), none worth forking. mnow-dev/AndroidFiles independently validated 8-stream parallel. Borrow patterns: SQLite manifest (ADB-X), resumable transfers (mtpx).

**Paper search:** Nothing useful on arXiv/alphaXiv for bulk ADB — practitioner topic. Empirical benchmarks stand.
