# android-fleet

ADB-managed Android devices on the LAN — the Architect's Pixel 9 Pro XL and the bedroom Google TV. (LG webOS TV tooling and streaming services have been decoupled to standalone `/home/toxic/nuvio/`). Scripts live here canonically; `/home/toxic/bin/` holds symlinks for PATH/supervisor compatibility.

## Why this exists

The fleet's reach ends where ADB begins — unless someone holds the sessions open. Wireless debugging ports rotate, TVs need on-screen approval, and a dropped session at 2am means no deploys until morning. This project keeps both devices reachable: a keepalive daemon that rediscovers the Pixel's rotating port, and documented, approved access to the TV that unlocks direct Kodi file deploys.

## Devices (`docs/devices.md`)

| Device | Endpoint | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pixel 9 Pro XL (the Architect's phone) | 10.0.0.77:44933 (rotates) | wireless debugging, paired | keepalive holds the session; port rediscovered via fast scan on rotation |
| Google TV "SmartTV 4K FFM" (bedroom) | 10.0.0.225:5555 | ADB authorized 2026-09-18 | Kodi host .225 — direct file deploys, no more JSON-RPC-only limit |
| LG webOS TV | developer mode / Homebrew Channel | webOS `ares` CLI over SSH | not ADB — see [`nuvio/`](nuvio/README.md) |

## Scripts (`bin/`)

- **pixel-adb-keepalive.sh** — holds the Pixel's ADB session over LAN wireless debugging. Reconnects every 60s; rediscovers the connect port via fast port scan (30000–50000) when wireless debugging rotates it. One-time pairing done 2026-09-17 (pairing persists in `/home/toxic/.android/adbkey*`, survives phone reboot). Run line in `pitchfork.toml` (`daemons.pixel-adb-keepalive`) points here. Additive only: never touches other adb devices (emulator-5554 etc.). Replaced the old Tailscale tcpip target (100.123.57.58:5555, dropped 2026-09-17 per the Architect: "new one drop other").

## Quick start

```bash
adb -s 10.0.0.77:44933 shell            # Pixel (port rotates — keepalive tracks it)
adb -s 10.0.0.225:5555 shell            # Google TV
adb -s 10.0.0.225:5555 push addon.zip /sdcard/   # Kodi file deploy
```

## Config

- Pixel pairing: `adb pair 10.0.0.77:<pair-port>` (one-time, code from the phone's "Pair with pairing code" screen). Keys in `/home/toxic/.android/adbkey*`.
- TV authorization: approved on the TV dialog 2026-09-18 (was `unauthorized` until the Architect approved it).
- Kodi data on the TV: `/sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/`.

## License & security

MIT where marked — [LICENSE](https://github.com/toxicwind/estate-scripts-projects#license). ADB is root-equivalent on the device — these are the Architect's personal devices on his LAN. The pairing keys (`/home/toxic/.android/adbkey*`) are credentials: never commit, never share. Keepalive is additive-only by design (never touches other adb devices).
